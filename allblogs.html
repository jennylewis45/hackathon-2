            <p>Apple could be putting an Action button on your next iPhone. According to a July report from MacRumors, code in the fourth iOS 17 developer beta hints at functionality for an Action button on the next-gen iPhone 15 Pro and Pro Max models.
                Apple introduced the Action button on the Apple Watch Ultra. It's a physical button on the side of the Apple Watch Ultra that allows you to run a preselected function or program when you press it without unlocking your device or navigating to an app. Some of the preselected functions include starting a stopwatch, 
                beginning a workout and turning on your flashlight.</p>
